## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- `JobsProvider`, a Faker provider built from the Job Description Dataset (Kaggle, ~1.6M postings): 147 job titles, 376 roles, 888 companies, 216 locations, 25 benefits.
- Job titles and roles (`job_title`, `job_role`, `job_role_record`, `job_description`, `job_skills`, `job_responsibilities`), picked in proportion to their number of postings (`weighted=False` for a uniform pick).
- Requirements and conditions: `job_qualification`, `job_qualification_name`, `job_experience`, `job_experience_range`, `job_salary_range`, `job_salary_bounds`, `job_work_type`, `job_benefits`, `job_portal`.
- Companies and locations: `job_company`, `job_company_profile` (filter by sector), `job_company_size`, `job_location` (filter by country).
- Full postings: `job_id`, `job_posting_date`, `job_posting`, with a localized contact person and phone number.
- `TypedDict`s for the returned dicts (`RoleRecord`, `LocationRecord`, `CompanyProfile`, `JobPosting`) and `py.typed`.
- `scripts/build_job_stats.py` (role popularity, benefits, numeric ranges from the full postings file) and `scripts/build_data.py` (packaged JSON).
- Demo (`python -m faker_jobs`) and 33 tests.
